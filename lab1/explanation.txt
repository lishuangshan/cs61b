I'm a junior in Shanghai Ocean University. My major is Software Engineering. 
I want to learn more about Data Structure.
I've started to follow this course yesterday (September 24 GMT +8:00).
Trying to upload lab1 files to the autograder but failed.
I'll appreciate it very much if the autograder accept my upload.
